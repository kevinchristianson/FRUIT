# FRUIT 
## Film Recommendations Using Intelligent Techniques

\
What is it?
------------
FRUIT is a movie recommendation system that, given films a user likes, will provide recommendations for other films they may enjoy.

\
How does it work?
------------------
FRUIT uses a collaborative filtering approach to give film recommendations based on what other users with similar interests have liked.
FRUIT uses data from [Netflix](https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data) and [GroupLens' MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
to train and test on.
